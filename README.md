# Velocity Vroom
Velocity Vroom is a dynamic web project that simulates an animated car moving across a picturesque landscape. This project utilizes HTML and CSS to create an engaging and visually appealing animation, showcasing practical applications of CSS keyframes, animations, and positioning.

# Features
Animated Car Movement: The car moves smoothly across the screen, mimicking a driving motion.
Rotating Wheels: Realistic wheel rotation synchronized with the car's movement.
Bouncing Effect: Subtle shake animation to simulate the car's bounce on the road.
Scenic Background: A static background that provides a realistic and immersive environment.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content and elements on the page.
CSS: For styling the elements and implementing animations.
Project Structure
index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
style.css: Contains the CSS styles and animations used in the project.
images/: Contains the image assets used for the background, car, and wheels.

How It Works
HTML Structure: The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the page, including the car, track, and background elements.
CSS Animations:
Car Movement: Defined using the @keyframes rule for smooth horizontal translation.
Wheel Rotation: Implemented with another @keyframes rule to achieve continuous rotation.
Shake Effect: A subtle @keyframes animation to simulate the car's bounce.
