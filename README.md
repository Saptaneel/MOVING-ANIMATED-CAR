# Velocity Vroom

**Velocity Vroom** is a dynamic web project that brings to life an animated car journeying through a scenic landscape. Leveraging HTML and CSS, this project delivers an immersive and visually captivating animation, showcasing the practical applications of CSS keyframes, animations, and positioning.

## Features

- **Animated Car Movement**: Smooth animation creates a lifelike driving experience as the car moves across the screen.
- **Rotating Wheels**: Realistic wheel rotation synchronized with the car's motion adds authenticity to the animation.
- **Bouncing Effect**: Subtle shake animation simulates the car's bounce on the road, enhancing realism.
- **Scenic Background**: Static background imagery provides depth and immersion to the environment.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the content and elements on the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styles elements and implements animations for dynamic presentation.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
- **style.css**: Defines the CSS styles and animations used in the project.
- **images/**: Directory housing image assets for the background, car, and wheels.

## How It Works

- **HTML Structure**: Establishes the foundational structure of the webpage, including elements for the car, track, and background scenery.
- **CSS Animations**: Utilizes `@keyframes` rules to orchestrate animations:
  - *Car Movement*: Smooth horizontal translation defines the car's motion.
  - *Wheel Rotation*: Continuous rotation adds realism to the wheels' movement.
  - *Shake Effect*: Subtle animation simulates the car's bounce on the road.
